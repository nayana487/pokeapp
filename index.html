    <h1>What Do Pokemon Look Like?</h1>
    <p>Oh no, the Pokedek has been hacked! All Pokemon photos have been replaced by
    images of chicken tenders. No worries, this app has your back. Click on the name of a Pokemon to
    see what they look like as you continue on your quest. Gotta catch 'em all!</p>

      <p id ="disclaimer">Disclaimer: The creator of this app only acknowledges the existence of the original
      150 pokemon. Unfortunately, the pokeapi doesn't let you filter out the posers. Though I probably could have
      chopped the list up myself in the js file.
